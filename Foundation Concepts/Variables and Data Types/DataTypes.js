//Data Types

//1- String

var myString = "My name is Azier!";
var password = "password1234!";
console.log(myString);


// 2- Number

var myNumber = 10;
var myOtherNumber = 5;
console.log(myNumber + myOtherNumber);


//3- Undefined

var myUndefined;
console.log(myUndefined);

//4- null
// Null and undefined are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably. They are very different! As you read above, undefined is the value that is given to a variable that has not yet explicitly been assigned a value. Null is a value that is explicitly assigned, and often used when wanting to explicitly state that nothing is currently being held in this variable.



//5- Boolean
// Boolean is a very fancy way of saying true or false!

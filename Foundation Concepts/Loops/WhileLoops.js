//In my counting example, i want to keep printing to the console while the number is less than or equal to 5. Let's write it out:

var num = 0;    // start a variable at 0
while (num <= 5) {        
    console.log(num);    // print the current value of num        
    num=num+1;       // increment num by 1
}
